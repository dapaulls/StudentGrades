StudentGrades
=============

SCENARIO:
City College is currently offering a number of courses with different modules. 
Each year a number of students enrol on different courses. 
At the moment they are maintaining the students' results manually, which is unreliable and a time consuming process. 
They need a reliable and robust information system to solve the problem. 
You are appointed as a system developer to develop a student grading program which must demonstrate the following things:

* The program should be able to take up to 10 different subjects.
* Each subject should have a mark out of 100.
* The program must generate a report to show total marks for each course and the final average. 
* The program must also show the grade for each subject and the final course grade e.g. A, B, C.
* If the user enters a mark less than 0 or greater than 100 then an error message should be displayed.
